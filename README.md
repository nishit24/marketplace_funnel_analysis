# Marketplace Funnel Analysis

This repository contains a take-home data analysis project focused on **conversion funnel performance** for Neighbor’s marketplace. The analysis explores how users move from **Search → View Listing → Request → Payment**, highlights bottlenecks, and provides data-driven recommendations to improve conversion.

## 📊 Project Overview

We were provided with four datasets:

1. **all_search_events** – user search activity  
2. **view_listing_detail_events** – when users click into a listing from search  
3. **reservations** – booking requests and payments  
4. **amplitude_user_ids** – mapping table for user IDs  

The goal is to measure funnel conversion, identify drop-offs, and make actionable recommendations.
